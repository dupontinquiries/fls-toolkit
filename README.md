# FL Studio Toolkit

## Introduction

This repo contains the source code for a cli that can be used to extract information from `.flp` and `.zip` files that are generated by FL Studio 20.

## What Can FLST Do?

Note that FLST is a powerful automation tool. You can use one command to repeatedly process data over an entire directory of project files.

### Basic Metadata

FLST can extract information such as author, time, BPM, key, track duration, number of used channels, & more.

### Drum Patterns

FLST can extract drum patterns from flp files so that you can save your favorite drum patterns in the universal `.MIDI` format.

### Sample Rendering

FLST can also render trackouts without having to open up

## Building

Use `cargo install -___-` to install on your system, then make sure that the CLI is accessible (if not update your PATH).
